An Empirical Study on the Effectiveness of Transferring Software Performance Prediction Machine Learning Models Between 
Compile-Time Configurations via Linear Transformation

## Installation instructions:
Note: All code is held in src folder

### Setup for Windows
1. Begin in the project root directory
2. Install Jupyter using `py -m pip install jupyter`
3. Create virtual environment folder using `py -m venv .venv`
4. Activate your virtual environment using `cd .venv/Scripts` and then `activate.bat`. If this has worked you'll now see 
a (.venv) prefix in your CMD window
5. Use `cd ../../src` to enter the src folder
6. Install all dependencies for the project using `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Add our virtual environment to the iPython kernel using `ipython kernel install --user --name=.venv`
8. Finally, run your Notebook inside our virtual environment using `py -m jupyter notebook`

Further instructions on how to run the code can be found in src/README.md
